				Le trio is located at Narayanhiti Path, right opposite to Narayanthan. Le Trio is a terrace as well as indoor restaurant. The view we get to see from the terrace is immensely beautiful. The food we ordered were Chicken Spaghetti in Red Sauce, Fish Fingers, Caesar Salad and Peached Iced Tea. </p>
				<p>
				The Chicken Spaghetti in Red Sauce is quite satisfying at Le Trio. You actually get three pieces of boneless chicken that is covered up in the red sauce and when you mix the sauce with the noodles, the taste of the sauce with the chicken and the noodles is really good it is neither saucy nor too spicy it has a perfect combo of flavors where you get the hint of oregano which makes it even better......

				My ultimate go to place and indeed my favorite place for the best food is undoubtedly  The Ghangri Suimai Cafe, it is located in Pulchowk right beside the Hardik Club, opposite the Suzuki Showroom. </p>
				<p>
				The Ghangri Suimai Cafe has a great ambience and great food. The most popular dish that you will find here is the suimai special open Mo:Mo, as interesting as it looks it tastes even better with the three different yet delicious  achars you get with the momos, the sour one, the sweet one and one that is spicy. The spices in those achars have the finest ingredients that make it so tasty. The mixture of the achar with the Mo:Mo is the burst of flavors in your mouth and it feels so heavenly..... </p>

				Cafe Soma, a well known cafe with it's easy locational and book peaceful environment is located at Jhamsikhel. We visited Soma to try their breakfast set and it was not a bad experience after all. </p>
			<p>

				So for breakfast we had ordered feta cheese omelete and egg toast with bacon in which you get two pieces of brown bread with butter and jam and a half piece of tomato and egg.
				Talking about feta cheese omelete, the egg you get in it is mixed with the feta cheese and spinach which is a perfect combo and has the taste of the feta cheese which is quite satisfying and the half tomato you get has its own smoked taste which is actually good.....
